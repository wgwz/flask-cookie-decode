Flask_Cookie_Decode 0.3.0 (2019-01-05)
======================================

Bugfixes
--------

- In all previous releases the CLI with the ``--timestamp`` CLI flag was actually
  returning the timestamp when the cookie was signed. *Not* the timestamp when the
  cookie expires, as it should have been doing.

  In all previous releases there was no error handling for expired cookies. This
  release now returns a ``ExpiredCookie`` when it is detected. (#1)


Improved Documentation
----------------------

- Updates the documentation to include some more details about the way the
  Flask session works, and things you should be looking out for from a security
  perspective. The documentation also reflects the latest in terms of the way
  the CLI works. (#1)
